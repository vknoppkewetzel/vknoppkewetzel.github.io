Portfolio website - updated April 2024

On 9/12/2025, Github continuously failed my 2FA authentication (Authy) and did not allow me to recover my account or begin the recovery account process. My Github is still logged in on my Desktop. This is my test to see if I can access my Github and push up this note. 

Give me back my Github :(
